TODO:
 * Create log file for data analysis: two types of entry
	 - ring size, number of colorings, number of signed matchings
	 - the "progess-bar" type thing

TODO:
 * Goal: find things that are hard to check
 	* length of chains of (Steinberger slides graph of kempe chains) (page 39)
	* try to recreate graph structure of steinberger slides ("reduction chains")
	* output those chains somehow (graphviz)
	* output numbering of (intermediate) ring colors?
	* logic Program that generates 4-colorings
	* goal?: make logic programming proof of reducibility (reduce.c as prolog-esque)
 * Figure out what the "contract" stuff is about (C-reducibility?)
 	* Does reduce.c try D-reducible then C-reducible or just C-reducible contract stuff?
		- Every configuration has a contract; merely sometimes the contract is
		  trivial.
 * Goal: Count number of C/D reducible configuration in different sets
 * TODO: Split files in RSST/anc into steinberger and robertson subdirectories
 	* Check arXiv for robertson, google for steinberger
	* steinberger: iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/... (In google drive)
	- Done.

TODO: Figure out why ./reduce RSST/anc/ring16.conf crashes:
	* It happens in function 'checkreality'
	* It's hard to figure out exactly where/why, because checkreality is called
	  by augment. augment calls itself recursively and in a loop, making it even
	  harder to debug.


Steinberger: find unavoidable set using only d-reducibility
	* modified constants in Robertson's program, used a different unavoidable
	  set.
	* Check changes made by commit 0fb6cc (or something)


Contracts: Define in Robertson 1997, page 11..???
	* A contract is something applicable to a free completion
	* A contract is a set of edges (in the program, 0 to 4 edges)
